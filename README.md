# PLP_hackathon_portfolio-website
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website,It is a basic modern static website made with plain HTML & CSS which showcases my skills and shows my proficiency in using HTML and CSS.
The colors that I have picked are neutral and visually appealing which are not straining to look at.
The fonts are also modern and visible which also prevents straining to the viewer.
It has five sections i.e hero section,skills section,projects section and contacts section.
Take your time and feel free to check out my code base.
                                          Thank you!
